# Project Title

Chit-Chat is a WebApp writen in JAVA Servlets, & JSP (Java Server Pages), that provides a venue for communities of users with a common interest to communicate in real time. Forums and discussion groups, in comparison, allow users to post messages but don't have the capacity for interactive messaging. The main motive behind this project was to learn the concept of JAVA Servlets and JSP in depth.
